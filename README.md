and these cards will be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain network.
also, make "NFT Trading Cards" to those who come up with recipes using MISO,and promote the use of food products made with MISO.

Digital MISO card operates on the Ethereum blockchain network, and each MISO card is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT).
Cards are automatically generated with parameters such as MISO ingredients, location of origin, etc.
Some of the cards are digital collectibles (limited, rare, super-rare and unique cards).

By making "NFT Trading Cards", there will be people who collect them and enjoy playing games with them,
We will also hold events and festivals to using "NFT Trading Cards" and form communication.
